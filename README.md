# Game Rules and Usage
We can explain this game using very complex words, but summarizing it, it's just
virtual cube which moving direction you change by tapping the screen. You can't control
anything else, except the tap! Take all the yellow cubes and avoid the labyrinth of
deadly walls, but don't spend all your steps!

GoCube is barely based on classic games like virtual ping pong and tetris. All music
in all seven levels is original and unique.

The three rules are simple:

1. Tap the screen to change de direction of the player (also to start the level).

2. Don't touch any wall, but take all the yellow cubes. (taken yellow cubes are shown on the right bottom of screen)

3. And remember... Don't spend all your steps! (be aware of the steps bar. Take some
extra steps: ||||||| )
