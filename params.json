You can't control\r\nanything else, except the tap! Take all the yellow cubes and avoid the labyrinth of\r\ndeadly walls, but don't spend all your steps!\r\n\r\nGoCube is barely based on classic games like virtual ping pong and tetris. All music\r\nin all seven levels is original and unique.\r\n\r\nThe three rules are simple:\r\n\r\n1. Tap the screen to change de direction of the player (also to start the level).\r\n\r\n2. Don't touch any wall, but take all the yellow cubes.\r\n   (taken yellow cubes are shown on the right bottom of screen)\r\n\r\n3. And remember... Don't spend all your steps! (be aware of the steps bar.\r\n   Take some extra steps: ||||||| )\r\n\r\n# Run project in Unity\r\n1. Clone this proyect into your local machine.\r\n2. Open your local copy using Unity 3D.\r\n3.
